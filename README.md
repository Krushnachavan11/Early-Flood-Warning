# 🌊 Early Flood Warning System using Java & IoT

This project is a **real-time flood monitoring and early warning system** developed in **Java** and integrated with **IoT components** to help predict and alert users about potential flood conditions. The aim is to **minimize the impact of flooding** by providing timely alerts, enabling quicker response, and ensuring public safety.

## 🔧 Technologies & Tools Used

- **Java (Core + Advanced Java)** – Logic and UI development
- **NetBeans IDE** – Application development environment
- **Figma** – UI design & prototype planning
- **Arduino Nano** – IoT microcontroller
- **Sensors** – Ultrasonic Sensor (water level), DHT11 (temperature & humidity), Rain Sensor
- **JDK 8** – Java Development Kit for compatibility with hardware interfaces
- **Serial Communication** – Java-Arduino communication via serial port

## 🚀 Features

- 📡 **Real-time Water Level Monitoring** via ultrasonic sensors
- 🌧 **Rainfall Detection** using rain sensors
- 🌡 **Environmental Monitoring** – Temp & humidity tracking with DHT11
- ⚠ **Threshold Alerts** – Generates warnings when water levels cross danger thresholds
- 💾 **Data Logging** – Stores real-time sensor data for analysis and reporting
- 📊 **User Interface** – Simple Java-based UI showing current flood risk status

## 💡 Objective

To **detect early signs of flooding** using IoT sensors and alert users through the software dashboard, allowing early evacuation and resource planning. The system can be deployed in flood-prone regions as part of a disaster management solution.

## 🔄 Future Enhancements

- 📱 SMS/Email alert integration using APIs
- ☁ Cloud-based dashboard for remote monitoring
- 🛰 GPS tracking of affected zones
- 🔁 Integration with government disaster alert systems

## 🌟 Importance of the Project

Floods are among the most devastating natural disasters, often leading to massive property loss and threats to human life. This project contributes toward building **smart disaster management systems** using **affordable and scalable IoT technologies**. By predicting flood risks early, this system can:
- Help local authorities plan evacuation strategies
- Reduce emergency response times
- Potentially save lives and reduce economic damage
